## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
###- Issue Summary
The outage lasted from June 17, 2024, at 2:00 PM (UTC+1) to June 24, 2024, at 11:30 AM (UTC+1). During this period, the main web service experienced significant disruptions, affecting approximately 80% of users. They encountered slow page loads, timeouts, and error messages. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to uneven traffic distribution across servers, causing server overload and intermittent downtime.

###- Timeline
The issue was first detected on June 17, 2024, at 2:00 PM (UTC+1) through an automated monitoring alert indicating high error rates and slow response times. Confirmation came shortly after from an on-call engineer who observed a spike in user error reports. Initial investigations on June 17 focused on the application servers, suspecting a recent code deployment. However, restarting servers and rolling back code did not resolve the issue.

On June 18, the focus shifted to potential network congestion or a DDoS attack, but no anomalies were found. By June 19, senior engineering and DevOps teams were involved. A review of load balancer logs revealed uneven traffic distribution. On June 20, redundant hardware swaps were performed without success. Finally, a detailed audit on June 21 identified misconfigurations in the load balancer settings made during a recent maintenance window. Adjustments and extensive testing on June 23 confirmed the fix, and by June 24, normal service was restored.

###- Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine maintenance update. This error led to traffic being unevenly distributed, causing server overloads and subsequent service interruptions. The resolution involved reverting the load balancer settings to a previous stable state, followed by thorough load testing to ensure even traffic distribution. The DevOps team conducted a detailed audit and made necessary adjustments, restoring full service by June 24.

###- Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent future occurrences, several improvements and specific tasks were identified. Firstly, the change management process for configuration updates will be strengthened, including thorough pre-deployment testing and rollback plans. Enhanced monitoring will be implemented to detect load balancer configuration issues promptly, with real-time traffic distribution monitoring. Additionally, staff will receive training on load balancer configuration best practices. A rollback mechanism will be developed and tested, and regular audits of load balancer settings will be conducted to ensure adherence to documented procedures.

###- Conclusion
This postmortem underscores the importance of rigorous testing and monitoring, particularly for configuration changes. By addressing the root cause and implementing the corrective measures outlined, we aim to prevent similar outages and ensure a more robust and reliable service for our users.
